# Design Pattern
Design patterns help in implementing design principles in practice. They provide well-defined, proven solutions to common software design problems.

## Why learn Design Pattern ?
- Help apply **design principles (SOLID)** in real-world code
- Provide **well-defined, proven solutions** to common software design problems
- Improve **code readability and structure**
- Promote **loose coupling** and **high cohesion**
- Make systems **easy to extend and maintain**
- Handle **changing requirements** effectively
- Encourage **reusability** and consistency in design
- Improve **communication** among developers using a **common/shared** vocabulary
- Widely used in **frameworks like Spring**
- Important for **system design discussions and interviews**

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are broadly classified into **three types**:

### 1. Creational Design Patterns
- Deal with **object creation mechanisms**
- Reduce **tight coupling** between code and object creation
- Control how and when objects are created

**Examples:**
- Singleton  
- Factory Method  
- Abstract Factory  
- Builder  
- Prototype  

### 2. Structural Design Patterns
- Focus on **class and object composition**
- Help form **larger structures** from smaller components
- Simplify relationships between classes

**Examples:**
- Adapter  
- Decorator  
- Facade  
- Proxy  
- Composite  
- Bridge  

### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
- Concerned with **communication and responsibility** between objects
- Define how objects **interact and distribute behavior**

**Examples:**
- Strategy  
- Observer  
- Command  
- Chain of Responsibility  
- Template Method  
- State  
- Mediator  
- Iterator
